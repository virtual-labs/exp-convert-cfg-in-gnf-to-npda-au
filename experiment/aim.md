### Aim of the Experiment  

The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate how a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** in **Greibach Normal Form (GNF)** can be converted into an equivalent **Non-Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (NPDA)**.  

**Objectives:**  
- To understand the structure and significance of CFGs when expressed in GNF.  
- To explore the working of NPDAs as computational models for recognizing context-free languages.  
- To gain practical knowledge of the step-by-step method for transforming grammar rules into automaton transitions.  

This experiment connects the theoretical foundations of formal language theory with practical applications by illustrating the correspondence between grammars and automata.
